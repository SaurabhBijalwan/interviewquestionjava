Question 1 : Program to convert a given number(Long) to words with test-cases.  Done
Question 2 :"Find the first non-duplicate character in a string. Return null if no unique character is found. : Done Need Improvement
    firstNonRepeatedCharacter( ""abcdcd"" ) --> 'a'
    firstNonRepeatedCharacter( ""cbcd"" ) --> 'b'
    firstNonRepeatedCharacter( ""cdcd"" ) --> null"
Question 3:Find target number in a given MXN sorted 2d matrix/////
 
/*
Find target in a given sorted 2d matrix
	[
	[2, 4, 5, 10],
	[12, 13, 14, 15]
	[20, 25, 50, 51]
	]
	*

Question 4: Done using two ways
1.Check whether given number is power of two

Question 5: Modification required
"2. Convert a 9-digit number to SI string Constraints:
 1. no leading zeroes 
 2. number not comma-separated 1469 -> one thousand four hundred sixty nine
  136,527,890 -> one hundred thirty six million five hundred twenty seven thousand eight hundred ninety 
input -> long output -> String "

Question 6 :Modification required if Question6 is changing the Array
Given an array of unsorted integers and a value k.Write a Java program to find the k th minimum element in the array
(Without changing the array given; should not use sort method)

Question 7 : Similar to Question 6
Given an array of unsorted integers and a value k.Write a Java program to find the k th minimum element in the array
(Without changing the array given; should not use sort method)

Question 8 : 
1. Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.
For example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].
