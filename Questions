Question 4: Done using two ways
1.Check whether given number is power of two

Question 5: Modification required
"2. Convert a 9-digit number to SI string Constraints:
 1. no leading zeroes 
 2. number not comma-separated 1469 -> one thousand four hundred sixty nine
  136,527,890 -> one hundred thirty six million five hundred twenty seven thousand eight hundred ninety 
input -> long output -> String "

Question 6 :Modification required if Question6 is changing the Array
Given an array of unsorted integers and a value k.Write a Java program to find the k th minimum element in the array
(Without changing the array given; should not use sort method)

Question 7 : Similar to Question 6
Given an array of unsorted integers and a value k.Write a Java program to find the k th minimum element in the array
(Without changing the array given; should not use sort method)

Question 8 : 
1. Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.
For example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].

Question 9 : Not Done feeling same as Question 3 code is not running
2. Find target number in a given MXN sorted 2d matrix/*

Question 10 : Simple stack created let check it is as per question or not
"3. 
BumperStack(int maxSize) : Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the maxSize.
  void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack hasn’t reached the maxSize.
  int pop() Pops and returns the top of stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
  void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.

Input
[""bumperStack"",""push"",""push"",""pop"",""push"",""push"",""push"",""increment"",""increment"",""pop"",""pop"",""pop"",""pop""]
[[3],[1],[2],[],[2],[3],[4],[5,100],[2,100],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,null,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,103,202,201,-1]
Explanation
bumperStack bumperStack = new bumperStack(3); // Stack is Empty []
bumperStack.push(1);                          // stack becomes [1]
bumperStack.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]
bumperStack.pop();                            // return 2 --> Return top of the stack 2, stack becomes [1]
bumperStack.push(2);                          // stack becomes [1, 2]
bumperStack.push(3);                          // stack becomes [1, 2, 3]
bumperStack.push(4);                          // stack still [1, 2, 3], Don't add another elements as size is 4
bumperStack.increment(5, 100);                // stack becomes [101, 102, 103]
bumperStack.increment(2, 100);                // stack becomes [201, 202, 103]
bumperStack.pop();                            // return 103 --> Return top of the stack 103, stack becomes [201, 202]
bumperStack.pop();                            // return 202 --> Return top of the stack 102, stack becomes [201]
bumperStack.pop();                            // return 201 --> Return top of the stack 101, stack becomes []
bumperStack.pop();                            // return -1 --> Stack is empty return -1."

Question 11: Done
"1.two linked lists->

") Stacks
    
 BumperStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the maxSize.

Question:22
Friend circle group alogorithm-Leetcode#547 :https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/
1)Write a function  that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present then returns count of nodes in loop. For example, loop is present in linked list it should return length, If loop is not present, then function should return 0.
2)Given a n x n matrix. The problem is to sort the given matrix in strict order. Here strict order means that matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order and for row ‘i’, where 1 <= i <= n-1, first element of row 'i' is greater than or equal to the last element of row 'i-1'.
"3)intersection of two sorted linked list.
first linked list:1->2->3->4->6
